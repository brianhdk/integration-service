Hi, and thanks for trying out the Portal which is pretty awesome!
To get started, modify your Program.cs as shown below to begin working with this.

Also make sure to visit the Project Home on https://github.com/vertica-as/integration-service for further documentation.

using Vertica.Integration.Portal;

namespace YourNameSpace
{
	class Program
	{
		static void Main(string[] args)
		{
			IntegrationStartup.Run(args, application => application
				.UsePortal());
		}
	}
}

Spin up the WebApi server by running the following command: WebApiHost

.exe WebApiHost
.exe WebApiHost -url:http://localhost:8123
.exe WebApiHost -url:http://localhost:8123 -service:install
