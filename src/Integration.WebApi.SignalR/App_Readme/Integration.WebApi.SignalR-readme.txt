Hi, and thanks for trying out the SignalR extension.
To get started, modify your Program.cs as shown below to begin working with this.

Also make sure to visit the Project Home on https://github.com/vertica-as/integration-service for further documentation.

using Vertica.Integration.WebApi;
using Vertica.Integration.WebApi.SignalR;

namespace YourNameSpace
{
	class Program
	{
		static void Main(string[] args)
		{
			IntegrationStartup.Run(args, application => application
				.UseWebApi(webApi => webApi
					.WithSignalR(signalR => signalR
						.AddFromAssemblyOfThis<Program>())));
		}
	}
}
