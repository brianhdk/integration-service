Hi, and thanks for trying out the Integration Service platform.
To get started, modify your Program.cs as shown below to begin working with this.

Also make sure to visit the Project Home on https://github.com/vertica-as/integration-service for further documentation.

using Microsoft.Owin;
using Owin;
using Vertica.Integration.Domain.LiteServer;
using Vertica.Integration.WebHost;

[assembly: OwinStartup(typeof(Experiments.Website.Startup))]

namespace Experiments.Website
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
        {
            app.UseIntegrationService(application => application
                .UseLiteServer(liteServer => liteServer.AddFromAssemblyOfThis<Startup>()));

            app.RunIntegrationService(nameof(LiteServerHost));
        }
    }
}
